		<h1>About iBetelgeuse</h1>
		<p>
			iBetelgeuse is an open source Augmented Reality (AR) browser for iPhone, designed to be compatible with Betelgeuse, a fork of the Gamaray AR browser available for Android. The browser loads a virtual world&ndash;called <em>dimension</em>&ndash;from the web, which contains text boxes and images that are positioned in this virtual world. This virtual world is then projected on the camera image to create an augmented reality. The user can look &quot;through&quot; the screen of their iPhone to see this augmented world, and move and rotate the device to look around.
		</p>
		<p>
			This browser's focus is on interaction. Any text box or image that is displayed on the screen can be clicked, which can result in a new world being loaded or a webpage being opened. This allows highly interactive worlds to be made, such as tours, quizes, or games. Users can create their own worlds using the Dimension Description Files below, or using a web based designer, called <em>ARena</em>.
